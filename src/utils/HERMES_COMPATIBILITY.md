# Styling with React Native Paper - Minimal Approach

## Update: Simplified Styling with React Native Paper

This project now uses React Native Paper's default styling with minimal customization.

## Benefits of Using React Native Paper

1. **No Hermes compatibility issues**: React Native Paper handles cross-platform compatibility
2. **Material Design components**: Modern UI components following Material Design guidelines
3. **Built-in theming system**: Consistent appearance across the app
4. **Simplified styling**: Minimal boilerplate

## How to Use React Native Paper Components

```javascript
// Just import components from react-native-paper
import { Button, Card, Text } from 'react-native-paper';

// Use Paper components directly with built-in styling
const MyComponent = () => (
  <Card style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
    <Card.Title title="My Card" />
    <Card.Content>
      <Text>This card uses default React Native Paper styling</Text>
    </Card.Content>
    <Card.Actions>
      <Button mode="contained">OK</Button>
    </Card.Actions>
  </Card>
);
```

## Simplified Theme Structure

- The app uses React Native Paper's `DefaultTheme` with no customization
- Basic backward compatibility is provided in `theme.js` for existing components
- Prefer using Paper components directly whenever possible
